
1.       Change the name Meg to Megan

For this question I will use the sed command to replace the name Meg with Megan in the datebook. First I use sed then s to substitute. I then type a slash with the name that currently exists(Meg) that I want to replace. After the slash I type the new name (Megan) that I’m replacing it with.

 

 


2. Delete the last  3 lines.

 

3. Print lines 2 through 4 .

 

4. Delete lines containing Place.

 

5. Print all lines where the birthdays are in the first week of the month.  Be careful of the dates for birthdays, the format is MM/DD/YY

 

6. Append three asterisks to the end of lines starting with Sir

Commands used:

Sed s/Meg/Megan/ datebook

 

 

 

2.       Delete the last  3 lines.

To delete the last 3 lines in the datebook I used the lowercase d delete command with semicolon separators. I also used $ to signify the last line.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Commands used:

sed ‘$d;$d;$d’ datebook

 

3.       Print lines 2 through 4 .

 

To print the lines 2 through 4 I used the sed command combined with the lowercase n parameter to suppress the automatic printing of pattern space. I then typed 2 as the starting line and comma 4 as the ending line. I also added p to print the current pattern space.

 

 

 

 

 

 


Commands used:

sed -n ‘2,4p’ datebook

 

4.       Delete lines containing Place.

For this question I need to delete all lines containing “Place”. To do this I will use the sed command with the parameter lowercase e. I then used slash Place slash d to find all lines  starting with “Place” and delete the pattern space.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Commands Used:

sed -e ‘/Place/d’ datebook

5.       Print all lines where the birthdays are in the first week of the month.  Be careful of the dates for birthdays, the format is MM/DD/YY

 

For this question I need to only listed the birthdays which begin in the first week of the month. To do this I need to  use -n and -r (regex extended) with sed. I first match 5 numbers from 0-9 and a colon. I then matched numbers [0-9] for the month in the birthday. Then I matched 1-7 for the first week of the month. I then printed the matching lines in the datebook.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Commands Used:

 

sed -n -r '/[0-9]{5}\:[0-9]+\/[1-7]\//p' datebook

 

 

 

6.       Append three asterisks to the end of lines starting with Sir

To append the lines starting with Sir I need to use sed with the lowercase -e parameter. I then enclose in single parenthesis, slash Sir slash a escape then three asterisks.  The a is used to append the line Sir with the  asterisks.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Commands used:

sed -e ‘/Sir/a\***’ datebook

 

 

 

 

7.       Replace the line containing "Westley Pirate" with the phrase "As you wish."

 

For this command I need to replace “Westley Pirate” With “As you wish.”. To start this I first used the sed command with the lowercase e parameter which will replace the pattern space with an output. I then used the lowercase s (substitute) to change the entire lines containing “Westley Pirate” to “As you wish.”

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commands used:

sed -e 's/.*Westley Pirate.*/As you Wish\./g' datebook

 

8.       Change Minerva McGonagall's birthday to 12/25/1960 . Assume you don't know Minerva's original birthday. Use a regular expression to search for it.

For this question I need to identify the line with the name Minerva McGonagall and change the birthday to 12/25/1960. First I use sed with the lowercase e parameter and find the line with Minerva McGonagall. Then I use three bracketed [0-9] numbers to identify the date within the line. After this I substituted the original date with 11/14/46.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Commands used:

sed -e ‘/Minerva McGonagall/s,[0-9]\+/[0-9]\+/[0-9]\+,11/14/46,’ datebook

 

 

9.       Delete all blank lines.

To delete all of the blank lines in the datebook I used single parenthesis to contain a pattern which starts with blank (using ^) and ends with blank (using $) and then use d to remove the lines within the datebook.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


Commands used:

sed ‘/^$/d’ datebook
